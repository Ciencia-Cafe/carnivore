# Carnivore Language Development Guide
This guide is for use of the contributtors to the language development itself, the contributors have to be members of the **Ciencia-Cafe** GitHub organization.

## Directory Structure
The directory structure may change in the future but currently it has to be like this:

- carnivore
	- doc
	- include
	- src

Ignored files and directories should be generated by a tool or script.

This is what is being used by the [.gitignore](../.gitignore):
```
.vscode
bin/
lib/
test/
buid/
*.log
```
The creation of header files `.h` is reserved to the `include` directory only and the creation of source files to the `src` directory.
Markdown files for the documentation have to be in the `doc` directory.

## Headers with implementation
Carnivore is meant to be simple to build, carnivore headers may implement functions to avoid having to compile multiple `.o` files, this may change in te future but it's unlikely to.

## Code conventions
* Identation Style: [K&R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#K&R_style) (Variant 1TBS)
* Function names: `snake_case`
* Type names: `CamelCase`
* main.c:
	* The main is reserved for the carnivore cli functions.
